# Advent Of Code

This repo uses the template created by Oliver Binns.

## Template

This is a template for you to complete Advent of Code using Swift.
It utilises Swift Package Manager, allowing you to write your solution for each day in the relevant folder within the `Sources` directory.

As each day you are provided with a sample input and answer, I recommend using a test-driven approach to the solutions.
You can write tests for your code in the `Tests` directory.


## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
You can play along on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com).
